                              dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                              volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                              the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                              provisioner.
                              This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                              if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                              When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                in any namespaces.
                              (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                              (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
