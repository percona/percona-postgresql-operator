## Introduction

[Percona Operator for PostgreSQL](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-postgresql/2.0/index.html) automates and simplifies deploying and managing open source PostgreSQL clusters on Kubernetes. It is based on [Postgres Operator](https://crunchydata.github.io/postgres-operator/latest/) developed by Crunchy Data.

Whether you need to get a simple PostgreSQL cluster up and running, need to deploy a high availability, fault tolerant cluster in production, or are running your own database-as-a-service, the Operator provides the essential features you need to keep your clusters healthy:

- PostgreSQL cluster provisioning
- High availability and disaster recovery
- Automated user management with password rotation
- Automated updates
- Support for both asynchronous and synchronous replication
- Scheduled and manual backups
- Integrated monitoring with [Percona Monitoring and Management](https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management)

While the Percona Operator is primarily managed through the command line, you can also use **[Percona Everest](https://docs.percona.com/everest/index.html)** for a web-based user interface. This open-source tool provides a streamlined experience for provisioning and managing your databases, simplifying day-to-day tasks and reducing administrative overhead. Learn more about Percona Everest in the [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/everest/index.html) or jump right in with the [quickstart guide](https://docs.percona.com/everest/quickstart-guide/quick-install.html).

## Architecture

Percona Operators are based on the [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) and leverage Kubernetes primitives to follow best CNCF practices.

Learn more about [architecture and design decisions](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-postgresql/2.0/architecture.html).

# Documentation

To learn more about the Operator, check the [Percona Operator for PostgreSQL documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-postgresql/2.0/index.html). 

## Quickstart installation

Ready to try out the Operator? Check the [Quickstart tutorial](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-postgresql/2.0/quickstart.html) for easy-to follow steps. 

Below is one of the ways to deploy the Operator using `kubectl`.

### kubectl

1. Deploy the operator from `deploy/bundle.yaml`

```sh
kubectl apply --server-side -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/percona-postgresql-operator/main/deploy/bundle.yaml
```

2. Deploy the database cluster itself from `deploy/cr.yaml`

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/percona-postgresql-operator/main/deploy/cr.yaml
```
