`Pause/resume PostgreSQL Cluster <pause.html#pause>`_
===============================================================================

There may be external situations when it is needed to pause your
Cluster for a while and then start it back up (some works related to
the maintenance of the enterprise infrastructure, etc.).

The ``deploy/cr.yaml`` file contains a special ``spec.pause`` key for this.
Setting it to ``true`` gracefully stops the cluster:

.. code:: yaml

   spec:
     .......
     pause: true

To start the cluster after it was paused just revert the ``spec.pause``
key to ``false``.

.. note:: There is an option also to put the cluster into a `standby <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/warm-standby.html>`_ 
   (read-only) mode instead of completely shutting it down. This is done by a
   special ``spec.standby`` key, which should be set to ``true`` for read-only
   state or should be set to ``false`` for normal cluster operation:

   .. code:: yaml

      spec:
        .......
        standby: false
