.. _users:

Users
==============================

User accounts within the Cluster can be divided into two different groups:

* *application-level users*: the unprivileged user accounts,
* *system-level users*: the accounts needed to automate the cluster deployment
  and management tasks.

.. contents:: :local:

.. _users.system-users:

`System Users <users.html#system-users>`_
-------------------------------------------

Credentials for system users are stored as a `Kubernetes Secrets <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/>`_ object.
The Operator requires to be deployed before PostgreSQL Cluster is
started. The name of the required secrets (``cluster1-users`` by default)
should be set in the ``spec.secretsName`` option of the ``deploy/cr.yaml``
configuration file.

The following table shows system users' names and purposes.

.. warning:: These users should not be used to run an application.

The default PostgreSQL instance installation via the Percona Distribution for
PostgreSQL Operator comes with the following users:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Role name
      - Attributes
    * - ``postgres``
      - Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS
    * - ``primaryuser``
      - Replication
    * - ``pguser``
      - Non-privileged user
    * - ``pgbouncer``
      - Administrative user for the `pgBouncer connection pooler <http://pgbouncer.github.io/>`_

The ``postgres`` user will be the admin user for the database instance. The
``primaryuser`` is used for replication between primary and replicas. The
``pguser`` is the default non-privileged user (you can configure different name
of this user in the ``spec.user``  Custom Resource option).

YAML Object Format
******************

The default name of the Secrets object for these users is
``cluster1-users`` and can be set in the CR for your cluster in
``spec.secretName`` to something different. When you create the object yourself,
it should match the following simple format:

.. code:: yaml

   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: cluster1-users
   type: Opaque
   stringData:
     pgbouncer: pgbouncer_password
     postgres: postgres_password
     primaryuser: primaryuser_password
    pguser: pguser_password

The example above matches what is shipped in the `deploy/secrets.yaml <https://github.com/percona/percona-postgresql-operator/blob/main/deploy/users-secret.yaml>`_
file.

As you can see, we use the ``stringData`` type when creating the Secrets
object, so all values for each key/value pair are stated in plain text format
convenient from the user's point of view. But the resulting Secrets
object contains passwords stored as ``data`` - i.e., base64-encoded strings.
If you want to update any field, you'll need to encode the value into base64
format. To do this, you can run ``echo -n "password" | base64`` in your local
shell to get valid values. For example, setting the PMM Server user's password
to ``new_password`` in the ``cluster1-users`` object can be done
with the following command:

.. code:: bash

   kubectl patch secret/cluster1-users -p '{"data":{"pguser": '$(echo -n new_password | base64)'}}'

.. _users.unprivileged-users:

`Application users <users.html#unprivileged-users>`_
------------------------------------------------------

By default you can connect to PostgreSQL as non-privileged ``pguser`` user.
You can login as ``postgres`` (the superuser) **to PostgreSQL Pods**, but
`pgBouncer <http://pgbouncer.github.io/>`__ (the connection pooler for
PostgreSQL) doesn't allow ``postgres`` user access by default. That's done for
security reasons.

If you still need to provide ``postgres`` user access to PostgreSQL instances
from the outside, you can edit the ``cluster1-pgbouncer-secret``
`Kubernetes Secret <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/>`_,
and add an additional line with the user credential to the 'users.txt' option.
This line should follow the `PgBouncer authentication file format <https://www.pgbouncer.org/config.html#authentication-file-format>`_: 

.. code:: text

   "username"  "password hash"

The "password hash" string consists of the following parts:

* "md5" string,
* MD5 hash of concatenated password and username.

You can generate MD5 hashsum for the password with the following command,
substituting ``<password>`` and ``<login>`` fields with the real password and
login:

.. code:: bash

   $ echo "MD5"`echo -n <password><login> | md5sum`

.. note:: Allowing ``postgres`` user access to the cluster is not recommended.
   Also, the Operator will not track password changes in this case, so you
   should maintain synchronization between PostgreSQL ``postgres`` password and
   its MD5 hash for PgBouncer manually.
