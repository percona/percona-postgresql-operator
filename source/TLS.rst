.. _tls:

Transport Layer Security (TLS)
******************************

The |operator| uses Transport Layer Security
(TLS) cryptographic protocol for the following types of communication:

* Internal - communication between PostgreSQL instances in the cluster
* External - communication between the client application and the cluster

The internal certificate is also used as an authorization method for PostgreSQL
Replica instances.

TLS security can be configured in several ways:

* the Operator can generate certificates automatically at cluster creation time,
* you can also generate certificates manually.

You can also use pre-generated certificates available in the
``deploy/ssl-secrets.yaml`` file for test purposes, but we strongly recommend
**avoiding their usage on any production system**!

The following subsections explain how to configure TLS security with the
Operator yourself, as well as how to temporarily disable it if needed.

.. _tls.certs.auto:

Allow the Operator to generate certificates automatically
=========================================================

By default, the Operator generates long-term certificates automatically and
turns on encryption at cluster creation time, if there are no certificate
secrets available. You do not need to perform any specific actions to make this
work.

.. _tls.certs.manual:

Generate certificates manually
==============================

To generate certificates manually, follow these steps:

1. Provision a :abbr:`CA (Certificate authority)` to generate TLS certificates,
2. Generate a :abbr:`CA (Certificate authority)` key and certificate file with
   the server details,
3. Create the server TLS certificates using the
   :abbr:`CA (Certificate authority)` keys, certs, and server details.

The set of commands generates certificates with the following attributes:

*  ``Server-pem`` - Certificate
*  ``Server-key.pem`` - the private key
*  ``ca.pem`` - Certificate Authority

You should generate one set of certificates for external communications, and
another set for internal ones.

Supposing that your cluster name is ``cluster1``, you can use the following
commands to generate certificates:

.. code:: bash

   $ CLUSTER_NAME=cluster1
   $ NAMESPACE=default
   $ cat <<EOF | cfssl gencert -initca - | cfssljson -bare ca
   {
     "CN": "*",
     "key": {
       "algo": "ecdsa",
       "size": 384
     }
   }
   EOF

   $ cat <<EOF > ca-config.json
   {
      "signing": {
        "default": {
           "expiry": "87600h",
           "usages": ["digital signature", "key encipherment", "content commitment"]
         }
      }
   }
   EOF

   $ cat <<EOF | cfssl gencert -ca=ca.pem  -ca-key=ca-key.pem -config=./ca-config.json - | cfssljson -bare server
   {
      "hosts": [
        "localhost",
        "${CLUSTER_NAME}",
        "${CLUSTER_NAME}.${NAMESPACE}",
        "${CLUSTER_NAME}.${NAMESPACE}.svc.cluster.local",
        "${CLUSTER_NAME}-pgbouncer",
        "${CLUSTER_NAME}-pgbouncer.${NAMESPACE}",
        "${CLUSTER_NAME}-pgbouncer.${NAMESPACE}.svc.cluster.local",
        "*.${CLUSTER_NAME}",
        "*.${CLUSTER_NAME}.${NAMESPACE}",
        "*.${CLUSTER_NAME}.${NAMESPACE}.svc.cluster.local",
        "*.${CLUSTER_NAME}-pgbouncer",
        "*.${CLUSTER_NAME}-pgbouncer.${NAMESPACE}",
        "*.${CLUSTER_NAME}-pgbouncer.${NAMESPACE}.svc.cluster.local"
      ],
      "CN": "${CLUSTER_NAME}",
      "key": {
        "algo": "ecdsa",
        "size": 384
      }
   }
   EOF

   $ kubectl create secret generic ${CLUSTER_NAME}-ssl-ca --from-file=ca.crt=ca.pem
   $ kubectl create secret tls  ${CLUSTER_NAME}-ssl-keypair --cert=server.pem --key=server-key.pem

If your PostgreSQL cluster includes replica instances (this feature is on by default), generate certificates for them in a similar way:

.. code:: bash

   $ cat <<EOF | cfssl gencert -ca=ca.pem  -ca-key=ca-key.pem -config=./ca-config.json - | cfssljson -bare replicas
   {
      "CN": "primaryuser",
      "key": {
         "algo": "ecdsa",
         "size": 384
      }
   }
   EOF

   $ kubectl create secret tls  ${CLUSTER_NAME}-ssl-replicas --cert=replicas.pem --key=replicas-key.pem

When certificates are generated, set the following keys in the
``deploy/cr.yaml`` configuration file:

* ``spec.sslCA`` key should contain the name of the secret with TLS
  :abbr:`CA (Certificate authority)` used for both connection encryption
  (external traffic), and replication (internal traffic),
* ``spec.sslSecretName`` key should contain the name of the secret created to
  encrypt **external** communications,
* ``spec.secrets.sslReplicationSecretName`` key should contain the name of the
  secret created to encrypt **internal** communications,
* ``spec.tlsOnly`` is set to ``true`` by default and enforces encryption

Don't forget to apply changes as usual:

.. code:: bash

   $ kubectl apply -f deploy/cr.yaml

.. _tls.connectivity.check:

Check connectivity to the cluster
=================================

You can check TLS communication with use of the ``psql``, the standard
interactive terminal-based frontend to PostgreSQL. The following command will
spawn a new ``pg-client`` container, which includes needed command and can be
used for the check (use your real cluster name instead of the ``<cluster-name>``
placeholder):

.. code:: bash

   $ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: pg-client
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         name: pg-client
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           name: pg-client
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: pg-client
             image: perconalab/percona-distribution-postgresql:{{{postgresrecommended}}}
             imagePullPolicy: Always
             command:
             - sleep
             args:
             - "100500"
             volumeMounts:
               - name: ca
                 mountPath: "/tmp/tls"
         volumes:
         - name: ca
           secret:
             secretName: <cluster_name>-ssl-ca
             items:
             - key: ca.crt
               path: ca.crt
               mode: 0777
   EOF

Now get shell access to the newly created container, and launch the PostgreSQL
interactive terminal to check connectivity over the encrypted channel (please
use real cluster-name, PostgreSQL user login and password):

.. code:: bash

   $ kubectl exec -it deployment/pg-client -- bash -il
   [postgres@pg-client /]$ PGSSLMODE=verify-ca PGSSLROOTCERT=/tmp/tls/ca.crt psql postgres://<postgresql-user>:<postgresql-password>@<cluster-name>-pgbouncer.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local

Now you should see the prompt of PostgreSQL interactive terminal:

.. code:: bash

   psql ({{{postgresrecommended}}})
   Type "help" for help.
   pgdb=>

.. _tls.no.tls:

Run Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL without TLS
===================================================

Omitting TLS is also possible, but we recommend that you run your cluster with
the TLS protocol enabled.

To disable TLS protocol (e.g. for demonstration purposes) set the
``spec.tlsOnly`` key to ``false``, and make sure that there are no
certificate secrets configured in the ``deploy/cr.yaml`` file.
